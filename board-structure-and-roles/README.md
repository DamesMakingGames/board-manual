# Board Structure and Roles

## Composition

According to Section 24 of the DMG Bylaws:

> “The board shall consist of the number of directors specified in the articles. If the articles provide for a minimum and maximum number of directors, the board shall be comprised of the fixed number of directors as determined from time to time by resolution of the board.”

The Board will strive to be diverse in its representation, with priority to new candidates given to racialized individuals, and individuals whose identities, abilities and backgrounds are underrepresented in the computer games industry and media arts sector.

Board members must qualify as Class A members according to the DMG Bylaws.

Board members will be appointed and/or elected according to the rules set out in the DMG Bylaws.

## Ideal Board Size

The Board will take reasonable steps to maintain a board with sufficient numbers to reflect the volume of work and the diversity of the membership.

According to the articles,  the board must consist of at least 3 and at most 9 members. 

## The Board’s Role

The Board is the group that leads DMG, setting its strategic direction and synthesizing input from the community into its programming. While we rely on trust and mutual accountability in service of the welfare and goals of the organization, we also believe that documenting our policies and procedures in this manual will ensure that this process will serve DMG well into the future.

The role of the board is to enable the organization to carry out its mandate, which, in part, is to:

* Provide educational and instructional conferences and workshops on topics relating to the arts exhibited at the premises
* Provide exhibitions of an artistic nature
* Make available to the public game arts, media arts, video arts, immersive arts, and electronic/computer arts
* Provide affordable production, work/practice and exhibition space to artists

* Articulate DMG’s vision, values, and principles 
* Hire and manage staff including an executive director, reporting to and carrying out the decisions of the Board

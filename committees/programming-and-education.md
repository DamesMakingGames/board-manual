**Co-chairs:** Jennie Robinson Faber & Izzie Colpitts-Campbell
**Members:** Yifat Shaik, Gabby DaRienzo, Kim Koronya, Jen Costa


## Lines of Communication

To ensure transparency for current and future committee members, committee business must be communicated and documented (in the case of offline conversations and decisions) through a dedicated Basecamp project for the committee.

* Additional Basecamp projects for committee projects may be created at thechair’s discretion. For example, the committee might start a new Basecamp project for a workshop series or long program, or if curriculum or other content will be developed over time. Non-committee members, outside coordinators,and clients can be looped in to a subset of content.
* The committee’s dedicated Slack channel should be used instead of email or Basecamp for roughing out ideas and general chatter about projects andscheduling.

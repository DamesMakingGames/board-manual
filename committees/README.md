# Committees and Mandates

## Committees

The Board may appoint committees whose members will hold office at the will of the Board, and may specify their remuneration, if any, and duties. The committees may hold their meetings at the head office or such place or places as the Chairperson may from time to time determine.

The following committees have been formed according to these governing terms:

* Conflict Resolution

Individual committee mandates and additional terms of reference will be drafted by each committee, approved by the Board, and may be amended from time to time with approval of the Board.

## Membership and Appointment

Each committee will be chaired by a non-staff member of the Board who reports to the Board regarding Committee business, decisions and activities. Committees will be comprised ideally of 3-5 members, including the chair, staff and volunteers. Members may be appointed to a committee by the chair or the board of directors.

## Committee Chair

The chair of the committee can be any one member of the board of directors. This responsibility is also set out in the role description for that director’s position.

The chair is responsible for:

* Scheduling the meetings
* Setting the meeting agendas
* Leading the meetings
* Recording and posting minutes
* Following up on action items
* Bringing motions to the Board for approval
* A co-chair may be appointed to fulfill the chair’s role in their absence.

## Committee Procedures

Each committee will maintain its own terms of reference, laying out frequency of meetings, composition and procedures. Additionally, the following rules apply to all committees:

* Committee meetings are open to any staff or board members who wish to attend without vote.
* Minutes must be taken at all committee meetings. A copy of all committee minutes should be made available to all board and staff members within 30 days of the meeting.

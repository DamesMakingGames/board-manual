# Policies

## Communication Policy

All communications within DMG will support the mission, vision, values and goals of the Board.

The Board will:

* Develop a communications plan which identifies who the Board communicates with, what is communicated, when communication activities occur (e.g., press releases), and how communications are delivered
* Establish communication links with the stakeholders and communities we serve, local governing bodies, arts organizations, ministries and funders
* Use communication strategies which are open and honest, responsive, informed and clear

## Finance Policy

### Operating Budget Process

* DMG will budget annually for a breakeven operating position, or an operating surplus to support its current working capital balance.
* The preliminary budget will be prepared under the direction of the Treasurer for review by the Board in its annual planning cycle each year.
* The annual budget will reflect the strategic priorities established by the Board of Directors of Organization.
* The Treasurer, in consultation with the Board, will establish the financial requirements for existing or new programs
* The final operating budget will be approved by the Board.

### Monitoring of the Budget

Responsibility for monitoring the operating budget rests with the Treasurer of Organization who can recommend changes to the Budget as the year progresses in order to maintain a break-even position.

### Authorities

Once approved, the Treasurer has the authority to make expenditures within the approved budget.

### Travel Expenses

DMG will reimburse any reasonable meal and transportation expenses associated with participation in Board meetings and duties delegated by the Board. Board directors must comply with the Travel Expense Policy.

## Governance Policy

The Board will govern with a style which emphasizes outward vision, encouragement of diversity in viewpoints, strategic leadership, clear distinction of Board and staff roles, collaborative decision-making, a focus on the future and proactivity.

The Board will:

* Be accountable for the realization of its goals
* Direct, control and inspire the organization through careful establishment of the broadest written policies which reflect the values and perspectives of its members and stakeholder communities
* The Board will monitor and regularly discuss the Board’s own process and performance to ensure the continuity of its governance capability by retention and development of Board members.
* Self-evaluate its performance
* Commit to continuous improvement, including orientation of new members and Directors to the Board’s governance model and periodic Board discussion of governance process

## Conflict of Interest Policy

The Board of Directors is responsible to the members of the Corporation and acts in their interests at all times. Directors must represent un-conflicted loyalty to the interests of the corporation. This accountability supersedes loyalty to any other organization, interest group, board or staff. It also supersedes the personal interest of any director acting as a consumer or participant in the activities of Organization.

* There must be no self-serving conduct of personal business between any Board member and DMG in order to ensure openness, competitive opportunity and equal access of information
* Directors must not use their position to obtain employment for themselves, family members or close associates
* Staff and non-Board Committee volunteers will act in accordance with the spirit and intent of the policy

### Declaration of Conflict of Interest

Directors in a decision-making role should make known their connections with groups or individuals doing business with DMG.

While this can be done annually as part of a review, it should happen at any point when a Director recognizes that the potential for conflict exists.

Directors who have an actual or potential conflict of interest will not participate in any vote or decision-making on matters affecting the organization, and the possible source of conflict. The Board will determine what, if any, contribution the Director can make to the discussion leading to a decision.

Directors will sign off annually on identified conflicts, and the record will be kept with the minutes.

## Sponsorship and Fundraising Policy

DMG affirms the position that core funding for arts programs remains the responsibility of various levels of government. We also believe the development of stronger links to the community, through sponsorship and fundraising, provides additional resources to enhance and build broader public support for arts programming. We are committed to fundraising based on ethical standards and within a socially responsible framework.

* DMG will actively solicit and accept financial support from donors and sponsors who agree with this philosophy and whose organizational practices meet these standards.
* DMG commits to managing responsibly the funds that donors entrust to us, and to report our financial affairs accurately and completely.
* DMG is committed to responding to donor or prospective donor questions or concerns about fundraising activities promptly and fairly.
* DMG supports a diversified and coordinated approach to funding and eschews competition for the good of the culture of DMG and the financial sustainability of its member organizations.
* DMG commits to using appropriate resources for the benefit of DMG as a whole rather than individual members.
